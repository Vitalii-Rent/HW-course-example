# Course HW example
This work consists of 3 parts - regression, classification and computer vision. 

Regression task was performed on Air Qualtity dataset where I tried to predict numerical air indicators; in this part I tried both ML and Dl methods. link to the dataset - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cf1oA7L9UM2B7HemJ9gFbr9IAgHquyfT/view?usp=share_link

Second part of the work is classification task. In this task I tried to predict diseases(or healthiness) of a patient based on the health indicators and symptoms. There were 4 unbalanced classes - healthy state and 3 levels of hypothyroidism. In this part I also tried both ML and DL methods. link to the dataset - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_eLhWbaoA6fcRhHm2qAC8QGpgA0luMwL/view?usp=share_link

Lastly, 3d part of the work is a computer vision task were I classified images which contained or didn't contain hot-dog. This part only contains deep learning solution using convolutional neuron network. link to the datset https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wHzu0NT-_3K2Tv9VRMnSx4TTZCUJIfJh.
