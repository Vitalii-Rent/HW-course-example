This work consists of 3 parts - regression, classification and computer vision. 

Regression task was performed on Air Qualtity dataset where I tried to predict numerical air indicators; in this part I tried both ML and Dl methods. 

Second part of the work is classification task. In this task I tried to predict diseases(or healthiness) of a patient based on the health indicators and symptoms. There were 4 unbalanced classes - healthy state and 3 levels of hypothyroidism. In this part I also tried both ML and DL methods.

Lastly, 3d part of the work is a computer vision task were I classified images which contained or didn't contain hot-dog. This part only contains deep learning solution using convolutional neuron network.
